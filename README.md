# Autonomous Robot Navigation in a Simulated T-Maze

This repository contains two subprojects developed as part of a Robotics course: **Behavior-Based Robotics (BBR)** and **Evolutionary Robotics (ER)**. Both projects aim to enable autonomous navigation of an E-Puck robot in a simulated T-maze environment using different robotics paradigms.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- **Simulator**: Webots  
- **Robot**: E-Puck  
- **Language**: Python  
- **Paradigms**: Behavior-Based Robotics (BBR) & Evolutionary Robotics (ER)  
- **Core Techniques**: Modular controllers, Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 📂 `BBR - Code/`  
**Behavior-Based Robotics implementation**

- `controllers/NEW_bbr/NEW_bbr.py`: Reactive controller using subsumption architecture for modular behaviors like wall-following and turning.  
- `controllers/Supervisor_BBR/Supervisor_BBR.py`: Supervisor to monitor and evaluate robot performance across trials.  
- `worlds/`: Webots world files and resources for T-maze simulation.  
- `README.md`: Specific notes for running BBR setup (included in the folder).  
- Hidden files like `.DS_Store` and `.wbproj` are auto-generated and can be ignored.

### 📂 `ER - Code/`  
**Evolutionary Robotics implementation**

- `controllers/epuck_python - ER/epuck_python - ER.py`: Main controller with an evolved neural network for adaptive navigation.  
- `controllers/epuck_python - ER/mlp.py`: Defines the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture used as the controller.  
- `__pycache__/`: Python bytecode cache (not needed for execution).  
- `README.md`: Notes specific to the ER implementation.  
- Hidden files and metadata can be safely ignored.

## 🚀 Performance Highlights

- **BBR**: Manually tuned reactive behaviors using modular design principles.  
- **ER**: Achieved 2× faster maze completion by evolving neural network controllers with multi-objective fitness functions.  
- **Result**: ER approach outperformed BBR in both adaptability and efficiency.

## 🛠️ How to Run

> **Requires**: Webots installed with Python controller support.

1. Open Webots and load the appropriate project from the `worlds/` directory.  
2. Set the corresponding controller for the E-Puck robot in the simulation.  
3. Run the simulation and monitor the robot’s navigation performance.  
4. For ER: Use the MLP code with genetic evolution if rerunning training.
